## 📌 Why Use DNS Filtering?

DNS filtering allows you to block unwanted content at the network level by preventing your devices from resolving certain domains. This approach helps you:

- **Block ads, trackers, and malware** automatically.
- **Improve network performance** by reducing unwanted traffic.
- **Enforce safe browsing** for children or employees.
- **Enhance privacy** by reducing exposure to tracking domains.
