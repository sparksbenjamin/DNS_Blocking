Welcome to **DNS Filters & Blocking Lists** — your one-stop repository for comprehensive and enriched DNS filtering solutions.

Our goal is to make DNS filtering **accessible, easy to understand, and ready to deploy** for everyone — whether you’re a home user, network admin, or privacy-focused professional.

## 📘 Why Use DNS Filtering?

DNS filtering allows you to block unwanted or harmful content at the network level — preventing devices from resolving specific domains.

✅ Block ads, trackers, and malware  
🚀 Improve network performance  
🧒 Enforce safe browsing policies  
🕵️ Enhance privacy by reducing tracking

---

## 🔒 Worried About DNS Bypassing?

You can enforce strict DNS routing and block or redirect outbound DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), DNS-over-TLS (DoT), and QUIC traffic.
